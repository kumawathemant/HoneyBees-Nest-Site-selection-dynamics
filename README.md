# Hive Site Selection in Honeybee Swarms
A study of the dynamics of decision-making in honeybee swarms of arbitrary size N using multi-agent distributed control over a fixed, connected graph

The directories have the following content:

Code: 

- Brute Force Search - shows simulations for varying sized networks and each of their respective unfolding cases. This search was done through a brute force grid search in the Beta parameter space.
- Multi-Agent Simulation - Houses code that displays the dynamics of the HoneyBee Nest Site Selection. These files include the transient behavior, bifurcation characterization along with adaptive control methods.

Data:
    Holds the results from each of the cases described above (.fig and .mat files)
